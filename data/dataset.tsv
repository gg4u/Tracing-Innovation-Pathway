40	R0:80			I think it is important to involve all partners with regular frequency because dissemination and communication activities are activities where all partners are obligated to attend by the European Community, but this does not always happen depending on partners… Anyway I look for continuity at least when in key moments, if there are concrete results… For example, we have a survey and must be finalized in time and we must meet so that there is enough time to discuss and edit it so that, if we must include an important point to measure in the [research and development] pathway, we can do it so that we can get first results and discuss them in the next meeting.	{'innovation steps conceived as surveys', 'regular frequency to share innovation steps with all partners is important'}	insight	{'innovation steps conceived as surveys', 'regular frequency to share innovation steps with all partners is important'}	{'importance of regular sharing with partners', 'innovation steps as surveys'}	{'regular sharing with partners importance', 'survey-based step capture'}

44	R0:87			Anyone, the focus of our company is on the exposition [of research driven activities, so it is appropriate that, like] in this case one must have a minimum of relevant background with the project being worked on, otherwise it is extremely difficult to enter in the scientific aspects of the project itself.	{'qualified background is necessary'}	perception	{'qualified background is necessary'}	{'need for qualified background'}	{'qualified background requirement'}
45	R0:88			Hence, I have been working, I am a biomedical engineer, but then I hold a PhD on mechanical systems and have worked on a robotics lab, so even if I don’t handle all the details of the project, I have an understanding that can help in appreciating different points of views.	{'personal purpose VS working purpose', 'minimum qualified expertise'}	perception	{'personal purpose VS working purpose', 'minimum qualified expertise'}	{'tension between personal and work purpose', 'minimum expertise requirement'}	{'qualified background requirement', 'tensions between roles and purposes'}

50	R0:94			As you said previously that there is the scientist, the communicator, the researcher : there must be a clear communication between us all first, but then it must be translated so as to be comprehensible to a common citizen, because the European Community has funded the project and it must be clear [to the public] what it is done with the money of the European Community - banally said.	{'communicating innovation is to report transparency'}	appropriate language	{'communicating innovation is to report transparency'}	{'communication as transparency reporting'}	{'communication as transparency reporting'}
51	R0:95			The part of dissemination – that is called divulging [“divulgazione”] in Italian; we are used to call it divulging in Italian but it is actually more marketing - the part of dissemination is instead more focused on the stakeholders, and moreover in this case, the stakeholders of [X] are not common citizens.	{'dissemination innovation is marketing'}	insight	{'dissemination innovation is marketing'}	{'dissemination of innovation as marketing'}	{'dissemination framed as marketing'}
